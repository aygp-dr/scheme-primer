Implementation notes:

Thought process:
- Analyzed entire repository structure and tested components
- Identified documentation gaps and immediate code quality issues
- Focused on making project more professional and 0.1.0-ready

Issues found and fixed:
- Typo: "pratice" -> "practice" in main primer greeting
- Version number was absurdly small (0.00000001) for a working system
- README was minimal and didn't reflect actual project structure
- No clear indication of what works vs what's planned

Cleanup performed:
- Updated README with comprehensive project overview
- Added status table showing educational module implementation status
- Documented testing results (faster-miniKanren passes all tests)
- Provided clear quick start instructions for both Chez and Racket
- Added repository structure documentation

Technical decisions:
- Set version to 0.1.0 as framework is working and this represents initial release milestone
- Used emoji status indicators in README for clear visual communication
- Documented that cons examples require Vicare (compatibility issue identified)

Testing results:
- primer.scm loads and runs in both Chez and Racket (menu system works)
- faster-miniKanren: all tests pass in Racket
- cons examples: fail in Racket due to Vicare-specific dependencies

Future improvements needed for full 0.1.0:
- Implement actual educational content for menu options
- Add proper error handling for unsupported Scheme implementations
- Create installation/setup documentation
- Add contribution guidelines

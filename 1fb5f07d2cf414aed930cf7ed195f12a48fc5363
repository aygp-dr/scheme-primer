Context: Development environment setup for Scheme Primer project

Considerations:
- Chose Makefile over shell scripts for better portability and clear targets
- Added both .envrc (for direnv users) and Makefile exports for flexibility
- Emacs configuration supports Geiser for Guile 3 specifically
- Included Paredit for structural editing of S-expressions
- Added Org mode support for potential literate programming use
- Tramp configuration included for potential remote development needs

Technical Decisions:
- PROJECT_NAME and PROJECT_ROOT exported as environment variables
- Tmux session named after project for easy identification
- Emacs started with -Q flag to avoid user config conflicts
- Project-specific keybindings use C-c p prefix to avoid conflicts

Issues Addressed:
- Consistent development environment across sessions
- Easy REPL access with proper project context
- Support for both interactive and batch testing
- Clean separation of project config from user config

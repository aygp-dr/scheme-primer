# scheme-primer
Interactive Scheme Primer, written in Scheme.

Inspired by 'The Diamond Age', spaced repetition, Rocksmith, 'The Little Schemer', Dan Friedman's C311 course, and my experience teaching Scheme over many years.

To run the Scheme Primer, please load the file `primer.scm` in Chez Scheme (https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/).

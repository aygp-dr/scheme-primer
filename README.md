# scheme-primer
Interactive Scheme Primer, written in Scheme.

*Work in progress*

Inspired by the primer in 'The Diamond Age', spaced repetition, 'Remembering the Kanji', Rocksmith, Zarf's 'Lists and Lists', Spock's test at the beginning of 'Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home', 'The Little Schemer', Dan Friedman's C311 course, and my experience teaching Scheme over many years.

To run the Scheme Primer, please load the file `primer.scm` in Chez Scheme (https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/):

```

> (load "primer.scm")
Welcome to the Scheme Primer.
```

The Scheme Primer may also work in other implementations of Scheme.

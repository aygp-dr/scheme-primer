# scheme-primer
Interactive Scheme Primer, written in Scheme.

Inspired by 'The Diamond Age', spaced repetition, 'Remembering the Kanji', Rocksmith, 'The Little Schemer', Dan Friedman's C311 course, and my experience teaching Scheme over many years.

To run the Scheme Primer, please load the file `primer.scm` in Chez Scheme (https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/):

```

> (load "primer.scm")
Welcome to the Scheme Primer.
```

The Scheme Primer may also work in other implementations of Scheme.
